# Kernel Panic and OOPS Examples

This repository is a collection of examples that demonstrate kernel panic, OOPs, BUG usages, and conditional compiling process in Linux kernel modules. Each subdirectory holds a different example, and they are easy to understand and implement.

## Introduction

In the development of Linux kernel modules, it is important to understand how to handle errors and unexpected situations. Kernel panic, OOPS (Out-of-Order Process State), and BUG are mechanisms used to handle such situations. Additionally, conditional compiling allows modules to include or exclude certain code sections based on predefined conditions.

This repository provides clear and concise examples of each of these concepts, making it easier for developers to understand and implement them in their own projects.

## Examples

### Example 1: Kernel Panic

The "kernel_panic" directory contains an example that demonstrates how to trigger a kernel panic intentionally. This example illustrates how kernel panic occurs and how it affects the system.

### Example 2: OOPS

The "oops_handling" directory demonstrates how to handle Out-of-Order Process State (OOPS) in Linux kernel modules. It provides an understanding of what causes OOPS and how to diagnose and handle it effectively.

### Example 3: BUG Usage

The "bug_usage" directory showcases various usages of the BUG macro in Linux kernel modules. BUG is a mechanism used to provoke a kernel panic when certain conditions are met. This example demonstrates how to use BUG effectively for error handling.

### Example 4: Conditional Compiling

The "conditional_compiling" directory presents examples of conditional compiling in Linux kernel modules. It shows how to include or exclude specific code sections based on predefined conditions, providing flexibility and customization options.

Each example is well-documented and easy to follow, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
